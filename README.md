# Cache_TemperatureLogger_DS18B20
Using ESP8266 WiFi Board, DS18B20 Temperature sensor, I log the temperature to the cache database using a REST service.

I have saved the additional Libraries needed into a seperate folder which you can copy into your default arduino libraries directory.
I have done the same for the cache classes, this will need to be imported into studio.

For the config which holds the WiFi credentials, you will need to rename the file in the Data directory to config.json
