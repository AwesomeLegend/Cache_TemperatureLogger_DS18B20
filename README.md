# Cache_TemperatureLogger_DS18B20
Using ESP8266 WiFi Board, DS18B20 Temperature sensor, I log the temperature to the cache database using a REST service.

I have saved the additional Libraries needed into a seperate folder which you can copy into your default arduino libraries directory.
I have done the same for the cache classes, this will need to be imported into studio.
